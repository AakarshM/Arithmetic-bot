# Basic-Arithmetic-Hack
Hack a simple *constant arithmetic website

This is a basic Selenium/Python work right now. My hopes are to expand this to a general arithmetic site where the users inputs div, time, and this can then handle any type of arithmetic (+, -, ****, /)
For now this only handles 2+2 (or a constant page)
